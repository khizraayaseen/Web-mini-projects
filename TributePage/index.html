        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Gone too soon, Arfa Karim, a Pakistani computer genius, who became a Microsoft Certified Professional at the age of nine in 2004, will be remembered and cherished for her intellect, potential, and achievements for Pakistan for which she received the Presidentâ€™s Pride of Performance Award in 2005. 
            Arfa passed away on January 14, 2012, at the age of 16, following an aneurysm. 
            In her memory, the Punjab Government named Lahore's Information Technology hub, housing Punjab Information Technology Board, after her. 
            Here's to hoping her life continues to be an inspiration to many and leads Pakistan to new heights of glory. 
            Rest in Peace, Arfa. </p>
